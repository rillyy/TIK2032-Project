                Most B.C. youth aren't exercising enough and it's linked to mental-health problems: UBC study
            </a> A recent study by the University of British Columbia reveals that a significant number of youths in British Columbia are not meeting Canada's recommended guidelines for daily physical activity, sleep, and screen time. Specifically, only 4% of surveyed students in grades 6 to 8 adhere to all three recommendations: at least one hour of physical activity, 8–10 hours of sleep, and no more than two hours of recreational screen time per day. The study highlights that excessive screen time is the most significant barrier, with only 14% meeting the screen time guideline. Importantly, youths who meet more of these guidelines report better mental health outcomes, including higher life satisfaction and fewer depressive symptoms. The findings underscore the need for interventions that promote balanced daily routines to enhance the well-being of young individuals .

                Can Music Help With Mental Health Issues?
            </a> 
            The KQED article delves into the emerging field of using music as a form of therapy for mental health conditions. It highlights initiatives like Sona Labs, a Los Angeles-based company aiming to have its music treatments approved by the FDA for conditions such as generalized anxiety disorder. These treatments involve specially composed music designed to stimulate brain activity associated with relaxation and stress reduction. The piece also references studies indicating that listening to certain genres, like improvisational jazz, can alleviate symptoms of pain and anxiety. This underscores the potential of music not just as entertainment, but as a viable component in mental health care strategies.

                Do animals suffer mental health problems?
            </a> 
            Animals, much like humans, can experience mental health challenges. According to a Live Science article, animals may develop psychological issues due to genetic or developmental factors, as well as environmental stressors. For instance, pets like dogs and cats can exhibit signs of cognitive dysfunction as they age, resembling human conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. Moreover, animals exposed to traumatic events or deprived of natural behaviors—common in captivity—can develop stress-related disorders. Recognizing these issues is crucial for ensuring the well-being of animals across various settings.

                Kesehatan Mental dan Fisik Harus Seimbang untuk Hidup Sehat
            </a> This article emphasizes the importance of maintaining both mental and physical health to achieve overall well-being. Clinical psychologist Nena Mawar Sari highlights that poor mental health can lead to physical issues, such as stress-induced inflammation and hormonal imbalances. Conversely, physical ailments can negatively impact mental health, especially in individuals with chronic illnesses. The Indonesian government's initiative to include mental health screenings in free health check-up programs is a proactive step towards early detection and intervention, aiming to reduce the prevalence of depression and suicide rates.
